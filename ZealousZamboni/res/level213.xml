		This level is a continuation on the previous level, but slightly more complicated
		due to having two skaters
		The trick is to immedietly sit at the center point of the level and let the skaters collide
		with you. After that, rush to the top to block the skater on the top from getting stuck
		the bottom one should take care of itself
