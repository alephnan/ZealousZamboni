		Left turn, left turn, left turn, left turn, left turn. In otherwords: Nascar. 

		The player will observe that the skater keeps turning left, despite the stone blocks
		seeming to be direction neutral. In fact, there are 7 such stones for the skater
		to turn at, but they turn left everytime.... 

		Maybe not necessarily the idea that EVERY skater turns left, but atleast the idea
		that there are skaters that only turn LEFT. This doesn't present the case where a left turn is not possible

	<problem>
		The spiral gets smaller and smaller, and the skater will die. 
	</problem>
	<solution>
		The zamboni needs to get to the spiral and clear it fast, and they have
		approximately a 3-5 second timeframe.
	</solution>
