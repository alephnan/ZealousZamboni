	<motivation>
		Illustrate the idea that two skaters, heading in same direction,
		facing the same obstacles, will have the same determistic path / decision making.
	</motivation>
	<problem>
		Both skaters will approximately die at same time, but it takes significant 
		amount of time to go back and forth
	</problem>
	<solution>
		1) Be very fast and go back and forth between both skaters
		2) For the skater on the right, "block" their path on the first time they head west,
		forcing them to go south into the wide open area. Then quickly go to the left skater and babysit them
	</solution>
	<progression>
		1) Level can be preceded by level that introduces player to strategy of using
		zamboni to "block" the skaters movement, forcing them to go in a certain direction.
		posibly, skater head to pitfall, and the only way to save them is by blocking them and 
		redirect them
		2) I toned the level to 17 seconds per skater. If this was increased to 20 seconds,
		the difficulty is a significantly harder
