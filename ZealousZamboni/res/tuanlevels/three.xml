	<motivation>
		A zig-zag pattern, and how redirection arrows are required to achieve this pattern,
		since skaters only turn left. 
		The skater on the left will need redirection arrows going south, and the stone
		will block them, such that they go to the east

		The skater on the right will need redirection arrows going west, and the stone
		will block them, redirect them south. 
	</motivation>
	<problem>
		Left unchecked, the left and right skater will quickly spiral into each other and both die
	</problem>
	<solution>
		Observe the zig-zag, and prevent the spiral from occuring.
