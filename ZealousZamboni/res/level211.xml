		This level will illustrate that skaters will get themselves stuck in their own trails
		it does so by tempting the player with lots of trail tiles at the opposite end of the map
		In reality, these tiles are unnecessary for beating the level, and instead the player
		should focus on clearing the horse-shoe shaped traps in front of each entrance
