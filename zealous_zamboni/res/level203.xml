	<motivation>
		Use of zamboni and/or skater trails to effect the paths of skaters
		Causes the player to think about trails as potentially helpful
	</motivation>
	<problem>
		Left unchecked, the second skater will almost immedietly get stuck
	</problem>
	<solution>
		Zamboni must direct the first skater out of the enclosed area to create a path which
		blocks the second skater
	</solution>
