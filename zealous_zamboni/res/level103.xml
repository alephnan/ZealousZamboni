	<motivation>
		A zig-zag pattern, and how redirection arrows are required to achieve this pattern,
		since skaters only turn left. 
		The skater on the left will need redirection arrows going south, and the stone
		will block them, such that they go to the east

		The skater on the right will need redirection arrows going west, and the stone
		will block them, redirect them south. 
	</motivation>
	<problem>
		Left unchecked, the left and right skater will quickly spiral into each other and both die.

		This will happen fast, so on the first time, the player might be too slow to react to win.
	</problem>
	<solution>
		Observe the zig-zag, (learned through a retry) and prevent the spiral from occuring. 

		Zamboni will need to immediately start heading to the spiral, and they only have about 3 seconds timeframe to be slow.
