		How do we show that skaters are not things to be ran over, but
		that the zamboni needs to save them?

		Also, provide obstacles to give the player the sense that the Zamboni
		drifts on the ice. So they when they go around corner, they have to account for this.

		On the first try, the player might try to hit the skater. But then immediately they lose
		and realize they shouldn't run over the skater.

		On the next try, the player might try to let the skater do whatever they want, but if they do this, they will observe the skater getting stuck and then dieing.

		Finally, the player might try to prevent the skater from getting stuck. But when they try this, they might not get it on the first try, because they might be slowed down by obstacles and won't make it on time.

	<problem>
		How to control the zamboni with its sliding motion on the ice, and go around corners.
		There are obstacles to slow player down still, after they realize they have to get to skater
		before skater traps themselves. 
	</problem>
	<solution>
		Gets used to going down the ice, without bumping into the walls and obstacles set in place to slow player down. Also, not every path is possible, as the zamboni won't fit through. The player will learn there is a single path to get to the zamboni, and that they have to get there in a reasonable amount of time.
