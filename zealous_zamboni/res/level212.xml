		This level will show that skaters will get themselves stuck in wall corner
		It is also the part that ensures the player knows they can redirect skaters with
		the zamboni, if they haven't learned it already. The level requires little movement
		if you are able to predict the path of the skater, but it is not expected
		that players can do that at this point
