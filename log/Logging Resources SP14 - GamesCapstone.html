<p>There are three files that you will need to integrate the CGS Logging API into your game.  All three files are provided in the project directory for your game, which you can find at /projects/instr/14sp/cse481d/&lt;your_game_name&gt; on any CSE machine.  Each file is described below:
</p>
<ul>
<li> CGSCommon.swc - This swc contains the Logging API.  To use this swc in your project in FlashDevelop, create a <b>libs</b> folder outside of your src folder and place the swc in that folder. Right-click on the swc file and select "Add to Library".  If this throws a warning message just click "Continue".  Then, right-click on the swc file again and select "Options".  Make sure that the "included library (include completely)" option is selected.  This will add the swc to your project so you can reference all of the classes and methods in the logging API.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Logger.as - This wrapper class contains all of the functionality that you will need to log data from your game.  Initialize the logger class using your game-specific information (see next bullet point).
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Logging.txt - This file contains the game-specific information that you should use to initialize the Logger class, as well as the username and password for your database.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> LoggingExample.as - This is an example class that uses the Logger.as to save some data.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> getdata_dev.py - This is the script for dumping data into a JSON object for the development server.  More information in the Analysis section below.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> getdata_prd.py - This is the script for dumping data into a JSON object for the production server.  More information in the Analysis section below.
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>

<p>The Logger.as class has the following functionality:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The Logger constructor will generate a new unique user ID that it will store and use for logging all events associated with that user.  It will retrieve that user ID from the cache if a player returns, which will allow you to measure return rate information.
</li>
<li> The logLevelStart function should be called each time a level starts, passing in a unique qid (level id) as described in the IDs section below.
</li>
<li> The logAction function can be called to record any information about what the player does during a level. This could be key presses, mouse clicks, or any other high-level information that you might want to know later. The logLevelStart function must be called before the logAction function, and the stored action data will be associated with the currently active qid (level id).
</li>
<li> The logLevelEnd function should be called a the end of each level, before calling logLevelStart on a new level. Note that if a player quits (closes the browser window) in the middle of a level, the level start and any completed actions will still be logged, even though logLevelEnd is never called.
</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of the logging functions allow you to pass in an arbitrary data object that will be saved along with the start, action, or end information.  An example class LoggingExample.as that uses the Logger.as file to store data is included in your project directories as well.
</p><p><br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="IDs">IDs</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/GamesCapstone/index.php?title=Logging_Resources_SP14&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: IDs">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>The Logging API requires a bunch of different IDs.  Here's an overview of what each one means:
</p>
<ul>
<li> GID: The id of your game. You can find it in logging.txt in your project space (see Files and Setup section).
</li>
<li> UID: The user id of the person playing. Automatically generated when the logging library initializes, and fetched from the cache if possible so returning users will have the same ID.
</li>
<li> CID: The category id of the current version. This is meant to segregate data into groups - Tuesday's playtest is cid 4, but Thursday's playtest is cid 5, making it easy to differentiate the data between both playtests. This should be used like a version id. You should add your cids to the database table 'categories' in your main game database.  It's also a good idea to use separate category ids for your debugging version so that your test data doesn't get mixed up with your real data.
</li>
<li> VID: Just to make it confusing, there's also a version id.  Just stick with 1 for all of your prototypes and use the cid to differentiate between versions.  We use the vid for vastly different versions of our games (not just tweaks) which is why this exists.
</li>
<li>QID: The level id. It actually stands for "quest id." No, I don't know why it's "quest" but that's the way the database is already set up, so we're stuck with it. Each level in your game should have unique qid, so you can tell which traces came from which levels.
</li>
<li>DQID: A trace id. Actually stands for "dynamic quest id." Bascially a unique identifier for a particular instance of a user playing a level. This is automatically generated by the logging library.
</li>
<li>AID: the action id of any particular action. Players may do things like kill enemies, pick up loot, move to a new location, etc.; each type of action should have its own id. You will have to generate these yourself. Typically you will also want to store detailed data along with the id. It's a good idea to keep a list of your AIDs somewhere so you know which numbers you've used in the past.
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Debugging">Debugging</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/GamesCapstone/index.php?title=Logging_Resources_SP14&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Debugging">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>For debugging purposes, you can access your data directly from the database.
</p><p><b>DO NOT query the database directly in your flash games.</b> This will be absolutely terrible for performance for everyone if you have any bugs. For example, a group in the past had a problem where every instance of the game accidentally queried the logging data for <i>every user</i> frequently. This brought the server to a crawl, and if your game has a bug like this and gets pirated, then you won't be able to fix it.
</p><p>Use the database to debug your logging and make sure that all of the information you want to record is actually being stored in the database.  Each game has three databases each with a ton of tables, many of which you will never need to look at (they are used in some of our other research games).  The only ones you need to care about are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> In the database cgs_gc_&lt;game_name&gt;:
<ul>
<li>categories: the table is where you should save your category ids (or if you don't want to do this, make sure to keep a secure list of them somewhere).
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> In the database cgs_gc_&lt;game_name&gt;_log:
<ul>
<li> player_pageload_log: Row for each time the game is loaded.
</li>
<li> player_quests_log: Row for each time you call logLevelStart/End.
</li>
<li> player_actions_log Row for each time you call logAction.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The columns should be mainly self explanatory if you know what the ids mean. anything with "ts" is a Unix timestamp. Anything with "detail" is your custom data. Anything else can probably be ignored.
</p><p><br />
To log into the database via the command line, follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li> ssh into any CSE machine
</li>
<li> type "mysql -h dev.db.centerforgamescience.com -u &lt;your_user_name&gt; -p" and then type your password.  You can find your username and password in the Logging.txt file in your project directory at /projects/instr/14sp/cse481d/&lt;your_game_name&gt;.  This will open the command-line mysql prompt.
</li>
<li> type "show databases"; to see all the databases
</li>
<li> type "use database &lt;name&gt;;" to select a database (you'll mostly want to look at cgs_gc_&lt;game_name&gt;_log)
</li>
<li> type "show tables;" to see all the tables in the databases
</li>
<li> type queries directly into the command prompt, for example "select * from player_actions_log order by log_ts desc limit 10;" to see the entries in the actions log ordered from most recent to least recent.
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>

<p>For any purpose other than debugging, it's best to access your data as a JSON object and analyze it with python scripts.  There are two files in your project directory at /projects/instr/14sp/cse481d/&lt;your_game_name&gt; that you can use to dump your data into a JSON object:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>getdata_dev.py</b> is for dumping data from the development server.  All of your games are currently logging to the development server, so you should use this script while implementing and debugging your game.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> <b>getdata_prd.py</b> is for dumping data from the production server.  There will be more information about setting up your game to log to the production server in the instructions for your first release.  We will use the production server for all of your real releases because it is more reliable and robust.  Please debug your logging on the development server first to make sure that it's working.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these scripts ask you to enter your game id and category id, for example "python getdata_dev.py &lt;game id&gt; &lt;category id&gt;".  The script will dump all of the players, traces, and actions for that game id and category id into a JSON file.  This script will only dump the data from that category id, which makes it very easy to separate data from different releases.  For example, you could use one category id to debug your game, another for your initial release to your friends, another for your first online release, and another for your Kongregate release.
</p><p>Unfortunately, CGS has not documented the format of the JSON object anywhere formal, but here's a high level idea. Your JSON object is a collection of players.  Each player has a number of properties like <b>pageloads</b> (the number of times the player loaded the game) and <b>levels</b> (level traces with unique dqids).  Each <b>level</b> has a set of <b>actions</b>, and each <b>action</b> has properties like <b>aid</b> (the action id for that action), <b>a_detail</b> (any extra information you stored along with the action), and <b>ts</b> (the timestamp for that action).  Feel free to explore the data structure yourselves, for example you can type "print player" in Python to see what the JSON data looks like for a whole player (it will look messy&#160;:)  If you have any specific questions about the JSON object let me know!
</p>

<p>Even though you ran some Python to generate the JSON dump (to fetch it from the CGS server), feeding that JSON <i>back</i> into python seems like a good way to explore your data. It turns into a nice python struct easily.
