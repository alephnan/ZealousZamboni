# ZealousZamboni

![Team whiteboarding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alephnan/ZealousZamboni/master/whiteboard.JPG)

This was a video game made for Video Game Capstone (CSE481). Includes a dolphin Zamboni and ofcourse Zombies. In addition to coding physics, sound logic and analytics, I synthesized music, made pixel art and level designed. Note that my original commits were from an older deleted Github account, which does not showup in contributors, but if you individually inspect commit history, you'll see commits by `automatwon`, which is me.
