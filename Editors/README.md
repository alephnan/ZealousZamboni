SimpleLevelEditor.jar:

Provides a GUI to create levels for our game.  The editor allows you to create a level, and then writes that level to the Zamboni resource folder in the proper CSV format needed by FlxTilemap.

- Requirements:
    - Jar file must be in "Editors" directory s.t. the path to the Zealous
      Zamboni resources file is: "../ZealousZamboni/res"
  
      You can change this path by editing the PATH variable in Main.java in
      the Level Editor src code folder, and recreating the jar file (just
      make sure to not commit & push it).

- How to:
    - First, you are prompted to enter your desired tilemap width and height.
      If you press "OK" or input values that cannot be parsed into ints, then
      the editor will use the default values: width = 40, height = 30.

    - Design the level!  Colors representing tile types are at the top of
      the GUI.
 
    - When you are finished designing the level, enter a valid filename into
      the text field and press "Done".  Before you exit, verify that the data
      was written to the "ZealousZamboni/res" folder.  (If it was not, you
      probably need to change the PATH variable in the LevelEditor source
      code, see above).
